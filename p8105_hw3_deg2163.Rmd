# ***Problem 1***

## loading the library and obtaining data
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")

## creating the brfss_smart2010_df
## as.factor(response) doesn't work 
brfss_smart2010_clean = 
   brfss_smart2010 %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
   rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
   filter(topic == "Overall Health" & (response == "Excellent" | response == "Very good" |
                                       response == "Good" | response == "Fair" | 
                                       response == "Poor")) %>%

```

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

```{r}
## In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations? CT, FL, and NC
brfss_smart2010_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  filter(n == 7) 

## Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.
brfss_smart2010_clean %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  distinct(county) %>%
  summarize(count_county = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count_county, color = state)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of locations in each state",
    caption = "Data from the brfss_smart2010 package"
  ) + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "States", 
    discrete = TRUE) + 
  theme_bw()
