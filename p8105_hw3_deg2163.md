### ***Problem 2***

``` r
## Load the data for instacart
data("instacart")
instacart = instacart 
```

Description of the dataset: There are 15 variables in the dataset that include information including when the items were ordered, days since the customer's last order, product name, aisle the item was located at, product id, order id, whether the item was reorder, user's id. There are some variables that are not clearly defined including eval\_set,order\_dow. I am assuming that order\_dow is referring to the day of the week the order was placed from 0-6 with 0 being Saturday according to some online research since those are the days with the most instacart orders. The dataset is structured so that each row is a different item from an order that was placed (i.e., 1,384,617 items were ordered via instacart).

``` r
## How many aisles are there?
instacart %>% 
 distinct(aisle_id) %>%
 count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   134

There are 134 aisles.

``` r
## Which aisles are the most items ordered from?
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                         |       n|
|:------------------------------|-------:|
| fresh vegetables              |  150609|
| fresh fruits                  |  150473|
| packaged vegetables fruits    |   78493|
| yogurt                        |   55240|
| packaged cheese               |   41699|
| water seltzer sparkling water |   36617|

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(aisle) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of items ordered per aisle",
    caption = "Data from the instacart dataset"
  ) + 
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

## Make a table showing the most popular item in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | 
         aisle == "dog food care" | 
         aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(most_popular_item = max(product_name)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| dog food care              | Zero Grain Turkey Dog Food      |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Zucchini Squash, Baby Courgette |

## Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | 
         product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_order_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  rename("Product Name" = "product_name", "Saturday" = "0", 
         "Sunday" = "1", "Monday" = "2", "Tuesday" = "3", 
         "Wednesday" = "4", "Thursday" = "5", "Friday" = "6") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| Product Name     |  Saturday|  Sunday|  Monday|  Tuesday|  Wednesday|  Thursday|  Friday|
|:-----------------|---------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream |     13.77|   14.32|   15.38|    15.32|      15.22|     12.26|   13.83|
